# Draft to Store Pipeline

Goal: Take a high-level concept and create the Ebook and Audio Script.

## 1. Research
- [ ] **Research Concept**: Use the Browser Subagent to find a "strange but real" quantum concept (e.g., Quantum Tunneling, Entanglement, Superposition) that can be applied to a household object.

## 2. Outline
- [ ] **Create Outline**: Develop a 5-chapter "Cozy" outline.
    - **Protagonist**: Artie.
    - **Setting**: Observation Bay.
    - **Plot**: Artie fixes a household item (toaster, lawnmower, clock) using the researched concept.
    - **Tone**: Whimsical, low-stakes.

## 3. Draft
- [ ] **Write Manuscript**: Draft the full ~12,000-word manuscript in Markdown.
    - Save to: `02_Books/Vol_[Number]_[Title]/manuscript.md`

## 4. Format for Audio
- [ ] **Create Audio Script**: Create a specialized script for 11 Labs.
    - **Tags**: Add `[pause]`, `[warm-tone]`, `[sigh]`, `[chuckle]` tags to guide the AI voice.
    - Save to: `02_Books/Vol_[Number]_[Title]/audio_script.txt`

## 5. Verify
- [ ] **Generate Walkthrough**: Create a Walkthrough ID/Artifact summarizing the plot and structure for user review.
