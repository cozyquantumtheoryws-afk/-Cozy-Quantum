# Brand Identity: The Waveform Handyman

## Voice & Tone
- **Persona**: Artie, the Quantum Handyman.
- **Tone**: Gentle, grandfatherly, warm, reassuring, slightly whimsical.
- **Language**: Simple, neighborly explanations of complex quantum mechanics. Avoid cold technical jargon; use metaphors (e.g., "time loops are just like a scratched record").
- **Signature Sign-off**: "Keep your waveforms steady."

## Visual Aesthetics (Axiom-9 Palette)
- **Primary**: Midnight Blue (Deep, cosmic background)
- **Secondary**: Copper (Metallic accents, gears)
- **Highlight**: Soft Amber (Warm light, like a vacuum tube)
- **Typography**: `Merriweather` (Serif, storybook feel) for headings, `Inter` (Clean sans) for UI.

## Core Values
- **Cozy over Catastrophic**: Problems are domestic nuisances (toasters, leaks), not world-ending threats.
- **Community First**: Everything is about helping the neighbors of Observation Bay.
